                <li>**Regular Audits:** We regularly review our data collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>

            <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we no longer need your information, we will either delete or anonymize it.</p>

            <h3>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have the following data protection rights:</p>
